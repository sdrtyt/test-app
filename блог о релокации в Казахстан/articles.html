            I will tell you a little about how my relocation to Kazakhstan began.
            It all started when the president of my former country announced the start of "partial mobilization".
            Due to the fact that partial mobilization began, my parents were very worried about my future because I fell under the criteria of this "tin"
            and without delay they decided to send me along with my half-brother to Kazakhstan, as it was the most suitable option.
            In addition, I always dreamed of visiting Kazakhstan, looking at the culture, life of people, traditions and their culture, but unfortunately because of what is happening
            in my country, compelled me to leave my former sojourn.
            Upon arrival in Kazakhstan, I was very surprised by the kindness and responsiveness of the locals, and also by the fact that they were ready to help strangers who came from a neighboring country despite what was happening in the neighboring country. After crossing the border, we stopped
            in a city near the border, the name of this city is Uralsk, on the way to the city we drove off-road, the distance between the city and the border was 47 kilometers.
            After we got to Uralsk, the first thing we did was buy local SIM cards so that we would have a connection. In addition, we rented an apartment for a couple of days near the station.
            After a week had passed and all issues were settled, we moved to Astana, the road to the capital took a day and a half.</p>

<h1>Как я начал играть в волейбол в Астане</h1>
<p>   Это было примерно 2-3 месяца назад, точно не помню. В то время я работал на складе в оптовой строительной компании и уже успел наладить отношения с коллегами. 
  Однажды узнал, что несколько ребят из компании играют в волейбол два раза в неделю, и я сразу сказал, что готов присоединиться, если будет нужен еще один человек.
  Честно говоря, до этого момента я не играл в волейбол с тех пор, как ушел из школы, может быть, даже больше. 
      На первых порах мое участие вызывало сомнения из-за моих неопытных игровых навыков, но мои новые знакомые оказались понимающими и адекватными. 
  Они начали помогать мне осваивать игру в волейбол, за что я им очень благодарен.
      Удивительно то, что, несмотря на то, что я чужой в этой стране, ко мне относятся дружелюбно и без осуждения из-за сложившейся ситуации, произошедшей из-за моей страны.
  Здесь я не ощущаю острой политической напряженности, хотя знаю, что есть люди с разными точками зрения на происходящее.</p>
